#1. The administrator makes agreement for the company using Web Services and receives 10-
#digit activation code to his/her mobile phone via SMS. It is valid for 7 days, but a new one can
#be ordered again from the branch office or from eSupport for corporate customers (see
#chapter 1.9)

#2. Banking software generates certificate signing request using the following information,
#which must be available when requesting a certificate from Nordea
#  name of the company (when company specific certificate) as in agreement
#  UserID as in agreement
#  country code (e.g. FI)
#  10 digit SMS activation code received by administrator registered into the agreement

#3. Banking software creates key pair for certificate and generates PKCS#10 request
#  (private key is newer sent to the bank)
#  use: key length 1024bit, SHA-1 algorithm, DER â€“encoded
#  Subject info: CN=name, serialNumber=userID, C=country (as above)

# Create 1024bit sha1 private key and generate Certificate Signing Request with it using parameters from cert_req.conf

#  use DER coded PKCS#10 above as input
#  SMS-activation code as the key (10-digits)

#  using schema: CertApplicationRequest
#TODO validation against schema before sending??
# Assign the generated PKCS#10 to as payload (goes to Content element)
